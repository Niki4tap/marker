**An experimental linting interface for Rust. Let's make custom lints a reality!**

> **Note**
>
> The project is in the very early stages of development, some things are still missing and the API is not stable yet.

## Status

What works:
- A basic Item and Pattern representation is available. Expressions and types are partially implemented
- Dynamic libraries can be loaded as *lint crates*. A few example lints can be found in the `marker_lints` directory
- The API is separated from the driver and translation layer. Rustc is currently the only backend development along with the API

What's next:
- The main goal is to complete the AST representation, and start on user tests
- A focus is also set on tooling. Working with marker should be simple and fun for lint developers and users.
- The project is designed to support multiple drivers and unify code analysis for Rust. Additionally, drivers like `rust-analyzer` will be investigated.
- ...and a lot more things! Check out the open [issues](https://github.com/rust-marker/marker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

## Running

The project is currently only available in this GitHub repo.
For a quick test, clone the repo and run `cargo dogfood`.
This will start `cargo-marker`, load [`./marker_lints`](./marker_lints) as a *lint crate* and run it in this repository.
